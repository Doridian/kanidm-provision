## Kanidm Provisioning Tool

This is a tiny helper utility that uses kanidm's API to provision
users, groups and oauth2 systems. This tool is needed to allow declarative
provisioning of kanidm in NixOS, but can be used on any other system as well.

## Usage

Build the utility simply by running:

```bash
> cargo build
```
